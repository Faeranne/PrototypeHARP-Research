For the best experience playing The Prototype we recommend a terminal that supports ANSI escape characters (also known as VT100 emulation). 

We have provided Tera Term for Windows users and CoolTerm for Mac users. 

If you need help connecting your terminal we recommend reading the "Serial Terminal Basics" tutorial from SparkFun: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics
